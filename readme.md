### Session tracking

In this simple example we are using [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) as our server. Also we use [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) to handle our cookie. 

An application comprises of many routes, the server is able to redirect yo to each route however it would be quite inconvenient if we had to login for each time we redirected. This is the purpose of the [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/). 

Also we use eslint, eslint is used to adhere to coding standards. it is largy customizable to suit your needs. This is not something that you would need to worry about but bear in mind a tool to enforce coding standards is VERY helpful. 

### Instillation 
`git clone` <br>
`npm install`<br>
`npm run dev`

### To-Do
